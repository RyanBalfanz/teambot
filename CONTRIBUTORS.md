The basis for this is a modified version of [Ryan Huber](https://github.com/rawdigits)'s [rtmbot](https://github.com/slackhq/python-rtmbot), which lives in rtmbot.py.

Thanks to [Ryan Balfanz](https://github.com/RyanBalfanz) for reviewing my code and working to make Teambot easier to deploy, and to [Gianluca Pacchiella](https://github.com/gipi) for doing some helpful cleanup work in parts of the codebase I'd neglected.
